# MDX Native Support

mdxdb is built from the ground up to work seamlessly with MDX documents. This means you can store and query rich content that includes both markdown and JSX components.

## Features

- Native MDX parsing and storage
- Component-aware querying
- Rich content support
- Markdown and JSX interoperability

## Usage

```typescript
import { createDatabase } from '@mdxdb/core'

// Create a database instance
const db = createDatabase({
  provider: 'fs',
  directory: './content'
})

// Query MDX content
const docs = await db.collection('posts').find({
  where: {
    // Query both markdown and component content
    content: { contains: 'React' }
  }
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Structure Your Content**: Organize your MDX files in a logical directory structure
2. **Use Components Consistently**: Define reusable components for common patterns
3. **Leverage Frontmatter**: Use frontmatter for metadata and querying
4. **Type Your Components**: Take advantage of TypeScript for component props
